Suburbs are generally located on the outskirts of cities and are often characterized by:
- Lower population density compared to urban areas
- Less commercial activity and fewer amenities
- More residential areas and green spaces
- Often have a more rural or countryside feel
- May have limited public transportation options
- Tend to be less densely developed and have more open spaces

In contrast, urban areas are typically:
- More densely populated and have a higher concentration of commercial and industrial activity
- Have a wider range of amenities, such as shopping centers, restaurants, and entertainment options
- Often have a more vibrant and diverse cultural scene
- May have more developed public transportation systems
- Tend to be more densely developed and have less open space

These differences reflect the unique needs and characteristics of each type of area. Suburbs are often designed to provide a more relaxed and peaceful environment, while urban areas are designed to be hubs of activity and commerce. By understanding these differences, visitors can better navigate and appreciate the characteristics of each type of area.

In the context of Thessaloniki, suburbs like Chortiatis and Kalamaria offer a unique blend of natural beauty and urban amenities. Chortiatis, with its mountainous location and scenic views, provides a tranquil retreat from the city, while Kalamaria, with its waterfront location and shopping center, offers a more urban experience. By understanding the characteristics of suburbs and urban areas, visitors can make the most of their time in Thessaloniki and appreciate the city's diverse range of experiences.","Suburbs are typically characterized by lower population density, residential areas, and more green spaces compared to urban areas, which are more densely populated and have a higher concentration of commercial and industrial activities.",0.0,0.55,0.29411764705882354,0.625037170844454,0.8333333332916666,0.0,0.0,0.14285714265306124,,0.6773369452687982

*   A square plan with a central dome
*   A cross-shaped plan, where the four arms of the cross meet at the center
*   A central dome that rises above the cross arms, often with a square or octagonal base
*   Typically, the dome is surrounded by four smaller domes or pendentives that connect the central dome to the cross arms
*   The cross-in-square design allows for a large, open interior space with a high ceiling, often used for liturgical purposes
*   The square base provides stability and support for the dome, while the cross arms add visual interest and create a sense of balance

Moni Latomou, as an early example of a cross-in-square domed church, embodies these architectural features. Its construction dates back to the 5th or 6th century, and it is believed to have been built by Theodora, daughter of the Byzantine emperor Maximilianus. The church's design is a testament to the artistic and cultural achievements of the Byzantine period.

The Greeks become at \nthis point in time the largest \npart of the population.\n ']," The Greeks became the largest part of the population in Thessaloniki during the late 19th century due to a combination of historical and economic factors. 

The 1st Balkan War, which broke out in 1912, played a significant role in this shift. The Greek army seized the town on October 26th, marking the end of the Ottoman occupation and the beginning of Greek control. This event led to an influx of Greek immigrants and refugees into the city, resulting in a significant increase in the Greek population.

Additionally, the establishment of a railway connection with Europe and Constantinople in the late 19th century facilitated the growth of Thessaloniki into a cosmopolitan European city. This connectivity enabled the city to attract immigrants from various European countries, including Greece, which contributed to the growing Greek population.

The infrastructure development in Thessaloniki, including the establishment of a railway system, streamlined the city's infrastructure and made it more attractive to immigrants. The city's seafront zone was also rebuilt after the 1890 fire, which may have created new opportunities for Greek immigrants to settle in the area.

Finally, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of European nationalism created an environment in which Greek immigrants could feel at home in Thessaloniki. The city's Greek community was able to maintain its cultural identity and traditions, while also embracing European culture and values.

Overall, the combination of historical events, economic factors, and infrastructure development created a favorable environment for the Greeks to become the largest part of the population in Thessaloniki during the late 19th century.","The establishment of a railway connection with Europe and Constantinople, along with streamlined infrastructure, contributed to the Greeks becoming the largest part of the population in Thessaloniki during the late 19th century.",1.0,0.26,0.34615384615384615,0.8262427803819589,0.9999999999,0.99999999995,0.0,0.571428570612245,,0.9999999999999994
